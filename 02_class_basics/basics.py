# I will start with the the 5th class, with we see the PEP-8 documentation one style guideline for Python
#     first of all the link to the guide https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
#     lets see the basics:
#         Comments, Declarations e Indentation
 
 
# Comments:
 
 
# now you can noticed the '#' is how to start comments
try_not_do_that = 'it' #is not a good way to make your's comments
 
 
# Declarations:
 
 
regular_variables = 'lowercase, separated by underscores'
CONSTANTS_VARIABLES = ['all variables can be modified', 'real constants don\'t exist', 'to indicate one "constant"',
'uppercase, separated by underscores']
 
 
# Functions and Methods:
 
 
def function_names():
 
    print('like variables should be lowercase, separated by underscores', 'and', 'two line blanks before and after')
 
 
# Class
